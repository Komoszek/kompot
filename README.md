# Kompot
This project aims to be modular online muliplayer game service written in TypeScript + React + Node.js. It is a spiritual successor to [setGameServer](https://github.com/Komoszek/setGameServer).

## Disclaimer
Although you are currently able to somewhat play games in [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)), this project lacks a lot of basic features like: proper room creation, game restarting, registered accounts, visible scoreboard, chat etc. My aim is to have it someday in fully working state.

## Installation
To install all required dependencies you need to run:
```
npm install
```
in three different places i.e. main directory, `kompot-frontend` directory and `kompot-backend` directory. After that, running this project is as simple as executing:
```
npm start
```
in the main directory.
